            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>DD Ride Service LLC was founded with a mission to revolutionize the ride-sharing industry. In recent years, drivers have faced increasing challenges and exploitation from major ride-share and gig economy companies. These challenges include unsustainable pay, lack of transparency, and unfair treatment. We started DD Ride Service to create a fairer, more transparent, and sustainable option for both drivers and customers.</p>
            <p>Our Revshare model ensures that drivers receive a fair share of the fare, leading to sustainable pay and improved job satisfaction. We believe in flat and transparent pricing for our customers, so you always know what youâ€™re paying for without any hidden fees or surprises. By prioritizing the well-being of our drivers and the satisfaction of our customers, DD Ride Service is committed to setting a new standard in the ride-sharing industry.</p>
            <p>Join us in our journey to make ride-sharing better for everyone. Choose DD Ride Service for your transportation needs and experience the difference that fair and transparent practices can make.</p>
